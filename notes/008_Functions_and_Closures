Functions and Closures

  Scala offers several 'ways' to do functions:
    1. Methods (functions that are members of an object)
    2. Functions nested within functions
    3. Function literals
    4. Function values

Methods

  We have already seen a lot of these
    - pretty similar to what you find in object-oriented languages

Local Functions

  "...programs should be decomposed into many small functions that each do a well-defined task.
   Individual functions are often quite small. The advantage of this style is that it gives
   a programmer many building blocks that can be flexibly composed to do more difficult things."

    - one problem with this method is that we can end up polluting the namespace with tons
      of random, small functions
    - In Scala, we can declare functions INSIDE other functions so that they have scope
      - we also have access to the 'private' modifier, but this only works on methods

  EX:

  import scala.io.Source

  object LongLines {
    def processFile(filename: String, width: Int) {
    
      def processLine(line: String) {
        if (line.length > width)
          print(filename + ": " + line)
      }

      val source = Source.fromFile(filename)
      for (line <- source.getLines) {
        processLine(line)
      }
    }
  }

    - processLine is only accessible inside of processFile; it is a local function

First-class Functions

  Saying that Scala has first-class functions means that functions can be passed around as values
  without names.

  EX: (x: Int) => x + 1
    - first-class functions can be stored in variables like other values 

  var increase = (x: Int) => x + 1
  increase(10) // now 11

  We can add more than a single statement to a function literal by putting the whole block in
  curly braces

  var increase = (x: Int) => {
    println("Inside our function")
    x + 1
  }

  "...a foreach method is available for all collections. It takes a function as an argument and 
   invokes the function on each of its elements."

  val someNumbers = List(-11, -10, -5, 0, 5, 10)
  someNumbers.foreach((x: Int) => println(x))

  - another method that takes in function literals is filter

    someNumbers.filter((x: Int) => x > 0) // Get just the posivite numbers

Short forms of function literals

  There are many cases where we remove the type declaration from our function literals

   someNumbers.filter((x: Int) => x > 0)
   becomes: someNumbers.filter((x) => x > 0)

  "You can simply start by writing a function literal without the argument type, and, if 
   the compiler gets confused, add in the type."

  Additionally, we can leave parens off of arguments whose type is inferred
    someNumbers.filter(x => x > 0)

Placeholder Syntax

  "To make a function literal even more concise, you can use underscores as placeholders for one
   or more parameters, so long as each paramter appears only one time within the function literal."

  someNumbers.filter(_ > 0)

  We can specify the type of the parameter by writing (_: Int) when necessary 

Partially applied functions

  "Although the previous xamples substitute underscores in place of individual parameters,
   you can also replace an entire parameter list with an underscore."

  someNumbers.foreach(println _)

  is equivalent to: someNumbers.foreach(x => println(x)) 

  The underscore here is really a placeholder, not for a single parameter, but an entire
  parameter list.

  "A partially applied function is an expression in which you don't supply all of the 
   arguments needed by the function. Instead, you supply some, or none, of the needed
   arguments."

  EX:
  
  // define our function sum
  def sum(a: Int, b: Int, c: Int) = a + b + c

  // take our partially defined reference
  val summer = sum _

  // use our reference
  summer(1,2,3)

  "Although you can't assign a method or nest function to a variable, or pass it as an 
   argument to another function, you can do these things if you wrap the method or nested
   function in a function value by placing an underscore after its name."

  In the example above, the function 'summer' is partially applied because it supplies
  none of the arguments to sum. We can also do truly 'partial' functions:

    val summer2 = sum(1, _: Int, 3)

    summer2(2)  // Returns 1 + 2 + 3

  In cases where a function is needed, and the entire parameter list is left, we can also leave 
  off the underscore.

    someNumbers.foreach(println _)

    can be written: someNumbers.foreach(println)

Closures

  Many function literals do not make reference to 'free variables'.

    (x: Int) => x + 1

    - x and 1 are all bound inside the scope of this function

  If we do the following:

    (x: Int) => x + more

    - more is a 'free variable'
    - the compiler will complain unless more was previously defined

    "But any function literal with free variables, such as (x: Int) => x + more, is an open term.
     Therefore, any function value created at runtime from this will by definition require that a
     binding for its free variable, more, be captured. The resulting function value, which will
     contain a reference to the captured more variable, is called a closure, therefore, because
     the function value is the end product of the act of closeing the open term."

    Scala's closures capture the variables, not the values to which they point.
      - changes made external to the closure are visible in the closure
      - changes made in the closure are visible outside of it

    
  def makeIncreaser(more: Int) = (x: Int) => x + more

    - generates a function that will incremement our argument by the value we initialized more to
    val increaser = makeIncreaser(1) // Adds one to argument to increaser
    increaser(1) // Returns 2

Repeated Parameters

  It is possible to create functions to which a client can provide a variable number of
  parameters

  def echo(args: String*) = 
    for (arg <- args) println(arg)

    - the asterisk indicates echo takes one or more Strings
    - internally, the inputs are converted into Array[String]

  If we want to pass an array of strings to echo we need to add ': _*'

    val array = Array("What's", "up", "World")
    echo(array: _*)

Tail Recursion

  Common approach to search problems:

    // Recursive functional style
    def approximate(guess: Double): Double = 
      if (isGoodEnough(guess)) guess
      else approximate(improve(guess)) 

    // Imperative loop style
    def approximateLoop(initialGuess: Double): Double = {
      var guess = initialGuess
      while(!isGoodEnough(guess))
        guess = improve(guess)
      guess
    }

  In Scala, these two versions are pretty similar with respect to efficiency, even though
    looping seems that it should be simpler/cheaper

  "Functions like approximate, which call themselves as their last action, are called tail recursive."
    - the compiler will optimize these into loops with updated parameters

  "A tail-recursive function will not build a new stack frame for each call; all calls will execute
   in a single frame." 

  EX:

    def boom(x: Int): Int =
      if (x == 0) throw new Exception("boom!")
      else boom(x - 1) + 1

    The above function is NOT tail-recursive
      - the increment option forces us to move into a new stack frame

  Scala does not have super rich support for optimizing tail-recursive functions
    - nested functions and mutually recursive functions are not optimized away
